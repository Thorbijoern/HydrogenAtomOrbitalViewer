# HydrogenAtomOrbitalViewer
## Webpage to show 3D Atomic Orbitals
There are alot of orbital viewers on the net, but they usually require you to run a java applet or 
shockwave player-little bit of dated tech for today. 

### This webpage is intended to do a few things:
* Give a short history behind the formulation of the physics behind the hydrogen atom and the people involved
* Explain some of the physics concepts for educational purposes
* Most importanlty, provide a hydrogen orbital viewer that should be able to run in most modern browsers without the need for
additional plugins
* Potentially run on mobile devices

Hopefully this my be a nice learning tool dor people to use, and a great introduction into quantum mechanics. :)
